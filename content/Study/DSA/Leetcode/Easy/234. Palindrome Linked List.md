- [x] Palindrome Linked List  [link](https://ticktick.com/webapp/#p/674f4562ebbe1a00000002b9/tasks/674fb39000abe8302ce4a8a2) #ticktick   ✅ 2024-12-12 📅 2024-12-09


## Problem Statement
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true`* if it is a *<span data-keyword="palindrome-sequence">*palindrome*</span>* or *`false`* otherwise*.

## Relevant Concepts
- [[Study/DSA/Data Structures/Linked List#Reversing a linked list\|Linked List#Reversing a linked list]]

## Approach
- To get the best time and space complexity we need to reverse the second half of the linked list and compare it to the first half.
	- This is the only way to get a solution with the time complexity in the order of `o(n)` and space complexity in the order of `o(1)`
## Solution
```Java

```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: 
- Space complexity: 

## Reflections
- I can't reverse a linked list to save my life.
