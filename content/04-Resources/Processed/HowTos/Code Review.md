## Code Review Checklist

### General

- [ ] Does the code work?
- [ ] Are variables, functions, class names descriptive enough?
- [ ] Code is easy to understand. Brevity is preferred over equivalent code written in fewer words/lines. 
- [ ] Code is written following the coding standards/guidelines (Followed across other projects in Flipkart).
- [ ] Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies.
- [ ] DRY. Is the same code duplicated more than twice?
- [ ] Can the code be easily tested (don't forget about React/UI components)?
- [ ] Are functions/classes/components reasonably small (not too big)?
- [ ] Event listeners if any, must be removed at unmounting/teardown.
- [ ] Naming conventions followed for variables, file names, translations.
- [ ] Separation of Concerns followed.

### Codestyle

- [ ] No hard coded values, use constants values.
- [ ] Avoid multiple if/else blocks.
- [ ] Commented out code is a strict no (exceptions exist)
- [ ] No unnecessary comments. The entity name should be descriptive enough to signify its use.

### Testing

- [ ] Tests are readable, maintainable, trustworthy.
- [ ] Test names (describe, it) are concise, explicit, descriptive.
- [ ] Avoid logic in your tests.
- [ ] Don't test multiple concerns in the same test.
- [ ] Cover the general case and the edge cases.
- [ ] Test the behaviour, not the internal implementation.
- [ ] Use a mock to simulate/stub complex class structure, methods or async functions.

## Frontend
### React

- Are components have defined propTypes?
- Keep components small and follow single responsibility principle.
- Functional components for components that don't use state.
- No api calls in containers, delegate to Sagas
- No state updates in loop.
- No useless constructor.
- Minimize logic in the render method.
- Don’t use mixins, prefer HOC and composition.

### Javascript

- Use ES6 features  
    - Use fat arrow function wherever possible. Be consistent in your usage.
    - Use spread/rest operator.
    - Use default values to prevent any errors from creeping in.
    - Use const over let (don't use var, unless legacy project).
    - Use import and export (require though discourage, is also valid).
    - Use template literals.
    - Use de-structuring assignment for arrays and objects.
    - Use Promises or Async/Await. Make sure the rejection of promise is also handled.
- Passes the threshold for unit test coverage.
- Passes all linting checks. All naming conventions are followed. [See ESLint](https://confluence.fkinternal.com/display/RET/Lint+Your+Code)
- All Classes, Class files, and Class members are Pascal case.
- All constants are Upper Case.
- All variables names, function names are Camel case.
- One Class per file.
- No circular dependencies.
- No null reference exceptions.
- Code is correctly formatted. [See Prettier](https://confluence.fkinternal.com/display/RET/Prettier+Code)
- No redundant or extraneous code. (e.g. unnecessary or commented out)
- All expected error scenarios are covered and accounted for.
- All unexpected error scenarios are covered and accounted for. (e.g. down services; malformed API responses; null, undefined, empty values; incorrect types)

### HTML/JSX

- All naming conventions are followed.
- Native HTML tags to be written in lowercase only
- React Element Tags follow Pascal case
- Use of Semantic HTML elements is preferred over generic elements.
- Code is correctly formatted. (e.g. attributes, nesting)

### CSS

- All naming conventions are followed.
- All selectors Kebob case.
- Only class and pseudo selectors. (No tag, id, name, etc.)
- CSS selectors are only as specific as they need to be; grouped logically in a file.
- Use of !important is forbidden. Why ? you ask… It's not important ![(tongue)](https://confluence.fkinternal.com/s/ed6ume/9012/tu5x00/_/images/icons/emoticons/tongue.svg)
- Only one level of nesting.
- Code is correctly formatted
- Adheres to correct units.
- Do not animate width, height, top, left and others. Use transform instead.
- Avoid inline styles.
- Use Hex color codes always, unless using rgba(). [Always check if that color is already defined in [common components](https://github.fkinternal.com/pages/Flipkart/fk-retail-utils/?path=/story/core-colors--palette)]
- No redundant or extraneous code. (e.g. unnecessary or commented out)

## What Should a Code Review Cover ?

### Readability

- Code should be easy to understand. When reading through the code, it should be relatively easy for anyone to discern the role of specific functions, methods, or classes.
- This reduces cognitive load when reading code.

### Maintainability

- Always make it a point that code is written to be easily to extendable and changeable.
- Whenever possible, try to decouple your logic and avoid any hardcoding.

### Security

- Writing insecure code introduces vulnerabilities into the system. As developers/reviewers, put yourselves in the shoes of someone trying to exploit the system.
- Examples — How could I exploit this code? What could be the impact of this to other downstream systems ? etc.

### Speed and Performance

There are two aspects to this -

1. Performance for users reflects the focus on how quickly your code performs for the end user. Key strategies are Lazy loading, caching, async and parallel processing.
2. Resource Consumption means not putting the system under more load than it needs to be under as a result of code or infrastructure choices.

A common pitfall is premature optimisation. Always be prudent in your approach.

### Documentation

Check whether the code you’re reviewing requires extra documentation to go along with it. Best approach is to have a well-written, up to date  README file in your project.

### Reinventing the Wheel

When reviewing code, make sure that the code uses all the appropriate language features.

The code shouldn’t re-implement functions that already exist in the language or libraries that the project uses.

### Reliability

When things go wrong in reliable code, the user experience should always be shielded from the impact as much as possible. When a certain level of failure is anticipated, it must be handled elegantly.

Code that assumes nothing will go wrong generally ends up failing catastrophically.

### Scalability

Consider scalability by imagining what might happen to the code you’re reviewing if it were put under unexpected load.

It’s important to consider what is likely to happen to the code under periods of very high usage when conducting code reviews.

### Reusability

Check that the code is written with likely future use-cases in mind. By the same token, make sure that the code doesn’t take this too far by trying to account for use cases which are unlikely to eventuate.

Remember, Code that’s never used is immediately legacy code.

DRY ( Don’t Repeat Yourself ) is one of the quickest improvements you can make during code review. A word of caution: it’s possible to take reusability too far and resulting in code that is so abstract and tries to accommodate so many potential use cases that it serves none of them well.

### Patterns

Your codebase likely already has its own style, and may have a dedicated style-guide. New code shouldn’t deviate from established patterns without good reasons.

### Test Coverage and Test Quality

Tests should be readable, maintainable, performant, and adhere to established patterns. Don’t stop at reviewing the tests that are there. Think through whether there are tests that are missing. Are there edge cases that haven’t been tested?

### Fit for Purpose

Before code is pushed to production, it’s worth double-checking that the code actually provides the functionality it was meant to provide. 

### Notice What’s Missing

Code review can encourage a bias towards considering only what’s in front of you. You review the code that you’ve been given. Reading between the lines (figuratively ![(tongue)](https://confluence.fkinternal.com/s/ed6ume/9012/tu5x00/_/images/icons/emoticons/tongue.svg)) can help in discovering a missing piece to a future problem.

### Zoom Out

One of the risks with code review is that it encourages a focus on the details of code, rather than the bigger picture.

If the approach itself is flawed, it can be a really difficult feedback to give, especially when the developer has spent several days working on a solution before requesting code review.

One of the best ways to make this more realistic is to ensure that pull requests are not too big. 

Pull requests should be small and frequently integrated. (You can use [Feature Toggles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) to push half cooked changes that aren't supposed to be exposed to end user)

| API Design                                                   |                      | APIs should be easy to use and hard to misuse. It should be easy to do simple things; possible to do complex things; and impossible, or at least difficult, to do wrong things.  <br>  <br>APIs should be self-documenting: It should rarely require documentation to read code written to a good API. In fact, it should rarely require documentation to write it.  <br>  <br>Avoid fixed limits on input sizes  <br>Names matter. Strive for intelligibility, consistency, and symmetry. Every API is a little language, and people must learn to read and write it. If you get an API right, code will read like prose.  <br>  <br>Keep APIs free of implementations details. They confuse users and inhibit the flexibility to evolve. It isn't always obvious what's an implementation detail:  <br>  <br>Consider the performance consequences of API design decisions, but don't warp an API to achieve performance gains. Luckily, good APIs typically lend themselves to fast implementations.  <br>  <br>Don't make the client do anything the library could do. Violating this rule leads to boilerplate code in the client, which is annoying and error-prone.  <br>  <br>Obey the principle of least astonishment. Every method should do the least surprising thing it could, given its name. If a method doesn't do what users think it will, bugs will result.  <br>  <br>Fail fast. The sooner you report a bug, the less damage it will do. Compile-time is best. If you must fail at run-time, do it as soon as possible.  <br>  <br>Provide programmatic access to all data available in string form. Otherwise, programmers will be forced to parse strings, which is painful. Worse, the string forms will turn into de facto APIs.  <br>  <br>Use consistent parameter ordering across methods. Otherwise, programmers will get it backwards.  <br>  <br>Avoid return values that demand exceptional processing. Clients will forget to write the specialcase code, leading to bugs.

Otherwise, clients will be forced to use exceptions for normal flow control, leading to programs that are hard to read, buggy, or slow.  <br>  <br>Throw unchecked exceptions unless clients can realistically recover from the failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
