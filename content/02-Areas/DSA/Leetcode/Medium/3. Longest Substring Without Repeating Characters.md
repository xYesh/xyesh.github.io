- [x] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters #leetcode  [link](https://ticktick.com/webapp/#p/674f4562ebbe1a00000002b9/tasks/67624b3d77fc763b4c99522d) #ticktick   ✅ 2024-12-18

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest <span data-keyword="substring-nonempty">substring</span> without repeating characters.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `s = "abcabcbb"`
>**Output**: `3`
>**Explanation**: `The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `s = "bbbbb"`
>**Output**: `1`
>**Explanation**: `The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `s = "pwwkew"`
>**Output**: `3`
>**Explanation**: `The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
>Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
>
>- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Relevant Concepts
## Scratchpad
```

- have a HashSet to hold the contents of the 2 pointer, if we find a duplicate, push up the left pointer till after the last occurrence.


```
## Approach
## Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int max = 0;
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (set.contains(ch)) {
                while (s.charAt(left) != ch) {
                    set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                    left++;
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                max = Math.max(max,i - left + 1);
                set.add(ch);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: `o(n)`
- Space complexity: `o(m)` where m is the largest size.
