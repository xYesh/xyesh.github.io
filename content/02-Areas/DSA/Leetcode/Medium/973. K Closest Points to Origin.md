## Problem Statement

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `&radic;(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)^2 + (y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)^2`).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

>
>**Input**: `points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1`
>**Output**: `[[-2,2\|-2,2]]`
>**Explanation**: `The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
>The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
>Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
>We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2`
>**Output**: `[[3,3],[-2,4]]`
>**Explanation**: `The answer [[-2,4],[3,3\|-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

>[!warning]+ Constraints

## Relevant Concepts

## Scratchpad
```

Create a priority queue with sorting based on the provided formula 

```
## Approach
## Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        
        PriorityQueue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> 
        {
            return Integer.compare(((b[0]*b[0]) + (b[1]*b[1])),((a[0]*a[0]) + (a[1]*a[1])));
        }
        );
        for (int[] point : points) {
            queue.add(point);

            if(queue.size() > k) {
                queue.poll();
            }
        }
        int[][] res = new int[k][2];
        for (int i=0; i<k;i++) {
            int[] curr = queue.poll();
            res[i][0] = curr[0];
            res[i][1] = curr[1];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: `o(nlog(k))` why log(k) ? Coz that is the max size of the Heap.
- Space complexity: `o(k)`
