## Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return *the distance of the nearest *`0`* for each cell*.

The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.

>
>**Input**: `mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0\|0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`
>**Output**: `[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
`

>
>**Input**: `mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]`
>**Output**: `[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1\|0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `m == mat.length`
>
>- `n == mat[i].length`
>
>- `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`
>
>- `1 <= m * n <= 10^4`
>
>- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
>
>- There is at least one `0` in `mat`.

## Relevant Concepts

## Scratchpad 
```

DP question ? 
- We can do a BFS at every level and find the answer but that will have exponential time complexity. 
-- is that the way ?


```



## Approach
- 
## Solution
```Java
# Solution
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: 
- Space complexity: 

## Reflections
- Have directions array and a validation function.
- Much easier than doing it one at a time based on the direction.
