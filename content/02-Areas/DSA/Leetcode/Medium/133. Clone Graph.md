## Problem Statement
Given a reference of a node in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph" target="_blank">connected</a> undirected graph.

Return a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy" target="_blank">deep copy</a> (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```


Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

<b>An adjacency list</b> is a collection of unordered <b>lists</b> used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

>
>**Input**: `adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`
>**Output**: `[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`
>**Explanation**: `There are 4 nodes in the graph.
>1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
>2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
>3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
>4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)
>
>**Input**: `adjList = [[]]`
>**Output**: `[[]]`
>**Explanation**: `Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `adjList = []`
>**Output**: `[]`
>**Explanation**: `This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
>
>- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
>
>- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
>
>- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
>
>- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
