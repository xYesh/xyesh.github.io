- [x] Missing Number  [link](https://ticktick.com/webapp/#p/674f4562ebbe1a00000002b9/tasks/67506ee87c6cbc102068019b) #ticktick   ✅ 2024-12-04

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array.*

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `nums = [3,0,1]`
>**Output**: `2`
>**Explanation**: `n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `nums = [0,1]`
>**Output**: `2`
>**Explanation**: `n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`
>**Output**: `8`
>**Explanation**: `n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `n == nums.length`
>
>- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
>
>- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
>
>- All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

>Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

## Relevant Concepts
- [[02-Areas/DSA/Algorithms/XOR\|XOR]]

## Approach
- Approach 1
	- Sort it and see which number is missing. `o(nlogn)` solution.
- Approach 2
	- Store it in a hashmap or something and do a 2 pass solution. `o(n)` space complexity though
- ~~Approach 3~~
	- ~~I think a **counting sort** can do it with the best complexity~~
- Approach 4
	- Just add them all up and compare them with the supposed sum to find the missing number. 
- Approach 5
	- XOR gate
## Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int sol = nums.length;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            sol ^=nums[i] ^ i;
        }
        return sol;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity:
- Space complexity:

## Reflections
- Think of various situations where the XOR gate can be useful
